OCaml Library Standard
======================

This repository defines a standard describing how OCaml libraries should
be organised and described once installed on the system. It aims to
allowing various tools & libraries such as `dune`, `ocamlfind` and
`findlib` to interoperate nicely and also to allow authors of OCaml
tools to make safe assumption when they need to use installed
OCaml libraries.

*Status:* the initial specification being developed between `dune` and
`ocamlfind`.
